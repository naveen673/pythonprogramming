"""
Consider the following scenario to write a python script using while loop.
Listen to our story: a boy and his father, a computer programmer, are playing with wooden blocks. They are building a pyramid. Their pyramid is a bit weird, as it is actually a pyramid-shaped wall - it's flat. The pyramid is stacked according to one simple principle: each lower layer contains one block more than the layer above.

Your task is to write a program which reads the number of blocks the builders have, and outputs the height of the pyramid that can be built using these blocks.
Note:Â the height is measured by the number of fully completed layers - if the builders don't have a sufficient number of blocks and cannot complete the next layer, they finish their work immediately.
Test the code using the test case provided below.
Sample Input: 6  Corresponding output: Height of the pyramid is 3
Sample Input: 20  Corresponding output: Height of the pyramid is 5
Sample Input: 1000  Corresponding output: Height of the pyramid is 44
Sample Input: 2  Corresponding output: Height of the pyramid is 1
