Here is a short story:
Once upon a time in Appleland, John had three apples, Mary had five apples, and Adam had six apples. They were all very happy and lived for a long time. End of story.
Your task is to:
•	create the variables: John, Mary, and Adam;
•	assign values to the variables. The values must be equal to the numbers of fruit possessed by John, Mary, and Adam respectively;
•	having stored the numbers in the variables, print the variables on one line, and separate each of them with a comma;
•	now add up the three variables inside the print function, and print the result of the addition to the console;
•	Finally, create the variable Total_Apples, equal to John + Mary + Adam. Print the variable to the screen;
•	experiment with your code. Create new variables, assign different values to them, and perform various arithmetic operations on them (e.g., +, -, *, /, //, etc.). Try to print a string and an integer together on one line, e.g., print("Total number of apples:", Total_Apples).

john=3

print("john, mary, adam")
print(john+mary+adam)

total_apples=john+mary+adam
print(total_apples)

print("Total number of apples:", total_apples)
